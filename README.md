# Lab Rat 
A tiny project to keep track of who comes and goes from the lab using [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org), [Twine](http://supermechanical.com/) and a [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/).

### Install
After grabbing the repo, then run:

	npm install

You will also need [isightcapture](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/18598/isightcapture) if you're running it from a mac.

### Setup
Once you have everything downloaded, go into the __config.js__ file to put in your own FTP settings. After that, you should be good to go.
